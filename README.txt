Welcome to the world of SNAKEs AND LADDERs :)

This game is written in JAVA Language -> using the concept of object-oriented-programming   :|

There is no GUI, this runs only on a command line prompt...

This game is "multiPlayered game" which runs only if the player enters correctly for the asked guess.
The guess question is basically on the player's name, like enter your 1st letter....., if you go wrong the question will be repeated till you answer it correctly.
(NOTE ::-> THERE IS NO SPECIAL CONSIDERATION FOR CORRECT/WRONG GUESSES, IT IS JUST TO KEEP THE GAME INTERACTIVE)

Therefore this is a game where you should guess and decide, whether to climb the ladders or get caught by the snakes.

This programm is written, keeping in mind a "SNAKE and LADDER board". 
You can see the board in this repository by name "snake_and_ladder_board.jpg"
